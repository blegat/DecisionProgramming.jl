If it is disease free, its expected market price as a breeding animal is 1000 DKKOnce a month, a veterinary doctor sees the pig and makes a test for presence of the disease. If the pig is ill, the test will indicate this with probability 0.80, and if the pig is healthy, the test will indicate this with probability 0.90. At each monthly visit, the doctor may or may not treat the pig for the disease by injecting a certain drug. The cost of an injection is 100 DKK.A pig has the disease in the first month with probability 0.10. A healthy pig develops the disease in the subsequent month with probability 0.20 without injection, whereas a healthy and treated pig develops the disease with probability 0.10, so the injection has some preventive effect.
