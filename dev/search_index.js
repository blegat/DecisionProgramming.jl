In the second stage, it is possible to carry out application (A) development projects which, when completed, yield cash flows that depend on the market share of the platform. This market share (M) depends on the competitiveness of the platform and the number of developed applications. The aim is to maximize the cash flows from application projects less the cost of technology and application development projects.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/multi-period-investment/#Formulation","page":"Multi-period Investment","title":"Formulation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"examples/multi-period-investment/#Individual-Projects","page":"Multi-period Investment","title":"Individual Projects","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"examples/multi-period-investment/","page":"Multi-period Investment","title":"Multi-period Investment","text":"(Image: )","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/multi-period-investment/","page":"Multi-period Investment","title":"Multi-period Investment","text":"The influence diagram of an individual multi-period investment project.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/multi-period-investment/","page":"Multi-period Investment","title":"Multi-period Investment","text":"Decision states to develop patents","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/multi-period-investment/","page":"Multi-period Investment","title":"Multi-period Investment","text":"d^PD^P=q_1^P q_2^P q_2^P q_3^P  q_D^P^P q_D^P+1^P","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/multi-period-investment/","page":"Multi-period Investment","title":"Multi-period Investment","text":"Decision states to develop applications","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/multi-period-investment/","page":"Multi-period Investment","title":"Multi-period Investment","text":"d^AD^A=q_1^A q_2^A q_2^A q_3^A  q_D^A^A q_D^A+1^A","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/multi-period-investment/","page":"Multi-period Investment","title":"Multi-period Investment","text":"Chance states of technical competitiveness c^TC^T","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/multi-period-investment/","page":"Multi-period Investment","title":"Multi-period Investment","text":"Chance states of market size c^MC^M","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/multi-period-investment/","page":"Multi-period Investment","title":"Multi-period Investment","text":"Probability ℙ(c^Td^P)01","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/multi-period-investment/","page":"Multi-period Investment","title":"Multi-period Investment","text":"Probability ℙ(c^Mc^Td^A)01","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/multi-period-investment/#Portfolio-Selection","page":"Multi-period Investment","title":"Portfolio Selection","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"examples/multi-period-investment/","page":"Multi-period Investment","title":"Multi-period Investment","text":"Technology project i costs r_i^Tℝ^+ and generates p_i^Tℕ patents.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/multi-period-investment/","page":"Multi-period Investment","title":"Multi-period Investment","text":"Application project k costs r_k^Aℝ^+ and generates a_k^Aℕ applications.

A healthy pig develops the disease in the subsequent month with probability 0.20 without injection, whereas a healthy and treated pig develops the disease with probability 0.10, so the injection has some preventive effect.
